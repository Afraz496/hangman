This is part of a time pass project. Using lists and string manipulation a console python game was created. The code is welcome to improvements such as the utilisation of GUI to make it more presentable as a computer program. Contributors are urged to develop a hangman which shows the basic hangman update his body parts on the console. In order to use the code, load it into an IDE or a text editor, run it with a file called "movies.txt" , you can modify the line of code to specify inputs but the input for this program is generally a text file.
